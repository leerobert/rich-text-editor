Attributes
The document schema also defines which attributes each node or mark has. If your node type requires extra node-specific information to be stored, such as the level of a heading node, that is best done with an attribute.

Attribute sets are represented as plain objects with a predefined (per node or mark) set of properties holding any JSON-serializeable values. To specify what attributes it allows, use the optional attrs field in a node or mark spec.

heading: {
content: "text\*",
attrs: {level: {default: 1}}
}
In this schema, every instance of the heading node will have a level attribute under .attrs.level. If it isn't specified when the node is created, it will default to 1.

When you don't give a default value for an attribute, an error will be raised when you attempt to create such a node without specifying that attribute.

That will also make it impossible for the library to generate such nodes as filler to satisfy schema constraints during a transform or when calling createAndFill. This is why you are not allowed to put such nodes in a required position in the schemaâ€”in order to be able to enforce the schema constraints, the editor needs to be able to generate empty nodes to fill missing pieces in the content.
